# About Me

My name is Lynne and I'm a senior frontend developer from Glasgow, Scotland.

I've been working as a frontend developer for 6+ years, and I'm currently working with Scss, Vue.js, React, and Umbraco.

In my spare time, I go to a circus school where I train handstands and aerial hoop. I'm a regular gym-goer and avid reader. I enjoy gaming (currently: Assassin's Creed: Origins) and going to the cinema.
