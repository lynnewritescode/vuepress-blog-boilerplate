I'm just back from the Vue.js Amsterdam conference. Lots of information to process. I've come back with enthusiasm and motivation to improve my work and to become a better JavaScript developer.

Things that I've been working on this week:

- [Stoic quotes Nuxt.js app](http://lynnewritescode.github.io/stoicquotes)
- Setting up this VuePress blog
- Being more engaged in the dev community
- Joined [Vue Vixens](http://vuevixens.org) community
- Looking into organising a local Vue meetup in the Glasgow, Scotland area

For a while I wasn't sure what I wanted this blog to be about, and I would put off writing anything. I've now decided to use it to record my thoughts and the things I'm getting up to, whether it's about development, life, travel or circus, it doesn't have to be super specific.

Hopefully this way I'll manage to keep posting fairly regularly!
