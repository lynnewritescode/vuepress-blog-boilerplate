## Hello World!

Just back from the Vue.js Amsterdam conference. Lots to process.

Things that I've been working on:

- Stoic quotes Nuxt.js app
- Setting up a VuePress blog
- Being more engaged in the dev community
- Joined Vue Vixens
- Looking into organising a local Vue meetup in the Glasgow, Scotland area
