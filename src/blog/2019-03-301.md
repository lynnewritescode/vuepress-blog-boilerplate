At the moment, I'm in a sort of state where I have to spend my time and energy focusing on myself and getting better. I may seem more distant or less chatty day to day, but I'm simply trying to spend the little energy that I have keeping myself going.

I've been spending more time reading, and meditating, and trying to make my surroundings peaceful. Just lots of little things that make a big difference to my state of mind.

I'm not being selfish. I don't care any less. In fact, if anything I feel guilty about it.
