This past week has been a bit of a mental rollercoaster, but I'm working through it. Work has been busy, and I'm starting on a new project which should be fun, despite the tight deadline. I've been pushing myself really hard at the gym, going most mornings with only 1 or 2 days off per week. I've just switched to PureGym, so will see how that goes!

My goal for this week is simply to keep my head above water and try not to get lost in my thoughts. To keep pushing hard, working hard, and making time for myself.

I watched the movies [To the Bone](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80171659?trackId=14751296&tctx=6%2C0%2Cca03622e-aba8-49a3-9d71-bac37a5c9539-18078511%2Cb82891de-1e5a-4e9d-9c71-4ff6c06f23fc_44351912X55XX1551648932653%2Cb82891de-1e5a-4e9d-9c71-4ff6c06f23fc_ROOT) starring Lily Collins, and [Brain on Fire](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80128245?trackId=14751296&tctx=6%2C1%2Cca03622e-aba8-49a3-9d71-bac37a5c9539-18078511%2Cb82891de-1e5a-4e9d-9c71-4ff6c06f23fc_44351912X55XX1551648932653%2Cb82891de-1e5a-4e9d-9c71-4ff6c06f23fc_ROOT) starring ChloÃ« Grace Moretz on Netflix recently and I loved them. They both have relatively depressing subject matter, and aren't particularly easy to watch, but I really felt for the characters and for me that's a big factor in enjoying a movie. Being able to empathize with the characters is what makes it for me, if I don't care about any of the characters then I just won't like it.

Another movie I really enjoyed this week was [Fighting with my Family](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6513120/). I saw it in the cinema on Friday and despite not being a huge wrestling fan, I grew up watching WWE and thought this film was great. It was funny and emotional, and I didn't know much about Paige until seeing the movie.

Also here are two songs that I'm in love with right now:
